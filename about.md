**Hey!** I am a student learning to cook and having a fun time doing it. I have never had the pressure of having to cook for myself in order to escape the ever impending doom of hunger, so I've decided to put myself into that situation and see what happens. My goal is to master the basics of preparation, cooking, and combining flavours to make cheap, great tasting meals. Join me on this crazy adventure. If I stop posting, I've probably starved to death, so please... tell my cats I love them.
