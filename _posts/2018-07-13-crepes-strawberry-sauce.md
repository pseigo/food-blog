## Crepes with Strawberry Sauce

It's important to keep health in mind for the Most Important Meal of the Day™, but I'm frustrated because my refrigerator won't stop running, I have to start with something sweet to make the morning a Little Bit Happier. I'm having crepes filled with a warm strawberry sauce and cool whipped cream, garnished with grated chocolate.

### Strawberry Sauce

This is the perfect opportunity to use strawberries that are turning into sad, wrinkly prunes. When they've been simmered, crushed, and coated in sugar, their imperfections are turned into something beautiful.

- Rinse and slice the strawberries into halfs—or quarters if they're real thicc
- Prepare a pan on low heat
- Place the strawberries, a cup of water, and 2 or more tablespoons of sugar in the pan
- Stir and let it simmer

The strawberries will begin to soften within 5 minutes. Once it begins to steam:

- Squish the strawberries with a fork or other object capable of squishing
- Turn the heat to medium
- Continue to stir until it is saucy enough for your liking, it shouldn't take long

This stuff is amazing when it's still hot, but make sure to wrap up the leftovers for later. It's great on crepes, pancakes, waffles, you name it.

### Crepes

This is where it gets really saucy. These things cook real fast, so I make sure to watch an episode of Rick and Morty before cooking to keep my IQ honed and reflexes at the ready.

I used a [simple recipe](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/16216/crepes/) for the batter:

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup \[cashew\] milk
- 1 egg
- 1 pinch salt

The cashew milk substitution works great, but the batter holds on for dear life in the pan with these proportions. I add a bit more milk to make it easier to spread.

- Pour 0.5-1 cup of batter in a buttered pan on medium high heat
- Flip the crepe when the top is dry and the bottom is starting to brown
- Cook the other side until it has browned to your liking

Repeat for the rest of the batter.

### Plating

My favourite part is making a dish look great on the plate.

I decide to load one side up with strawberry sauce, whipped cream, and finely grated baker's chocolate. Roll it up like a very wide burrito and voila. Top it with some more whipped creme and chocolate and garnish the rest of the plate.

A trick is to take a small spoonful of sauce, place it on one side of the place, and sweep the sauce across to the other side of the plate using the bottom of the spoon. I didn't use this for the cover image, but it's an easy way to make a plate look great.

### Final thoughts

A solid 8/10. Fun to make and a nice way to start a lazy day. I wouldn't make it all the time because they are quite sweet, but the strawberry sauce can easily be substituted for savoury fillings.
