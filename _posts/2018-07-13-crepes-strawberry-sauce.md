## Crepes with Strawberry Sauce

It's important to keep health in mind for the Most Important Meal of the Day™, but when my refrigerator won't stop running, I have to start with something sweet to make the morning a Little Bit Happier. That something is crepes filled with a warm strawberry sauce and cool whipped cream, garnished with grated chocolate.

### Strawberry Sauce

This is the perfect opportunity to use strawberries that are turning into sad, wrinkly prunes. When they've been simmered, crushed, and coated in sugar, their imperfections are turned into something beautiful.

- Rinse and slice the strawberries into halfs—quarters if they're real thicc
- Prepare a pan on low heat
- Place the strawberries, a cup of water, and a couple tablespoons of sugar in the pan
- Stir and let it simmer

The strawberries will begin to soften within 5 minutes. Continue once it begins to steam.

- Squish the strawberries with a fork or other object capable of squishing
- Turn the heat to medium
- Continue to stir until it is saucy enough for your liking, it shouldn't take long

This stuff is amazing when it's still hot, but make sure to wrap up the leftovers for later. It's great on crepes, pancakes, waffles, you name it.
