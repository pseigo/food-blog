## Spaghetti with Egg and Cheese Sauce

This dish is incredibly easy to make and delicious to eat. I'm making a classic spaghetti carbonara without the guanciale or pancetta because I don't have any and I'm hungry. The sauce is made from raw eggs, parmesan cheese, and seasoned with salt and pepper. Finally, the dish is garnished with fresh parsley, grated parmesan cheese, and a bit of pepper.
